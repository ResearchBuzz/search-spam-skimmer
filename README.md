I was reading an article in Search Engine Journal about a spam attack that Google's search results are currently under. The article mentioned that the spammers were operating with recently-registered domains. That made me wonder if I could dodge the spam by forcing Google into date-bounded searches that end two days before today. The idea is that if you set the content you're searching on a 48-hour delay, Google will had enough time to shake the hit-and-run spam out. 

So I made this very simple bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a bookmark revved up with some JavaScript. Save it somewhere like your bookmarks bar where you can click on it to open it. When you click it, it'll ask you for your Google query, which it will then "translate" to a date-bounded Google query that ends two days before today. I haven't done tons of testing on it but I liked the results I got enough to share.
